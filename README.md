## Description

*Mongo Music Scraper* is a full-stack node/express app, using MongoDB with Mongoose ODM. The app allows users to scrape NPR music's website for the latest music news, save articles for later, and add comments to articles they have saved. 

This app was created for week 15 of UT Austin coding bootcamp. The focus of this unit was to learn MongoDB with Mongoose, creating associations between multiple models. We also dug into web scraping using Cheerio to pull data that we used for this project.
